The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international event for high school students, organized by FIRST®. Each year, teams made up of students, mentors, and coaches design and build robots to compete in a challenge. These robots must complete a variety of tasks that change annually — such as shooting balls into goals, hanging from bars, placing objects in specific zones, or balancing on various field structures. At the start of the season, teams receive a standard kit of parts during the official Kickoff event, but they are also encouraged to design, fabricate, and purchase additional components to enhance their robot’s performance.

            <p>
              INFINITE RECHARGE is the 2020 game for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm as part of the Star Wars: Force for Change initiative. In the game, two alliances of three teams each compete in a futuristic, Star Wars-inspired city called FIRST City. Teams score points by completing tasks such as shooting foam balls ("Power Cells") into goals, spinning a Control Panel, and climbing or parking on a Shield Generator. The goal is to energize and activate the shield before an asteroid strike ends the match.

            <p>
              INFINITE RECHARGE returned as the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) game for the 2021 season, continuing its partnership with Lucasfilm and the Star Wars: Force for Change initiative. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the season began without any in-person events, marking a first in FRC history. Teams instead participated in three virtual challenges with judged awards. While some regions, like FIRST Chesapeake, planned limited hybrid events, FIRST later announced that no North American events would be approved before June 2021.

              RAPID REACT presented by The Boeing Company, was the 2022 game for the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), centered on a transportation theme as part of the FIRST Forward season. In each match, two alliances of three teams compete to score points by launching inflatable balls called Cargo into a central Hub, and by climbing within their Hangars during the endgame. The goal is to outscore the opposing alliance before time runs out.
